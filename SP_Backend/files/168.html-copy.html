SRL Mammoth Mountain seasonal change Mammoth Mountain seasonal change These two false color composite imges of the Mammoth Mountain area in the Sierra Nevada Mountains Calif show significant seasonal changes in snow cover The image at left was acquired by the Spaceborne Imaging Radar C and X band Synthetic Aperture Radar aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on its th orbit on April The image is centered at degrees north latitude and degrees west longitude The area is about kilometers by kilometers miles by miles In this image red is L band horizontally transmitted and vertically received polarization data green is C band horizontally transmitted and vertically received polarization data and blue is C band horizontally transmitted and received polarization data The image at right was acquired on October on the space shuttle Endeavour s th orbit of the second radar mission Crowley Lake appears dark at the center left of the image just above or south of Long Valley The Mammoth Mountain ski area is visible at the top right of the scene The red areas correspond to forests the dark blue areas are bare surfaces and the green areas are short vegetation mainly brush The changes in color tone at the higher elevations e g the Mammoth Mountain ski area from green blue in April to purple in September reflect changes in snow cover between the two missions The April mission occurred immediately following a moderate snow storm During the mission the snow evolved from a dry fine grained snowpack with few distinct layers to a wet coarse grained pack with multiple ice inclusions Since that mission all snow in the area has melted except for small glaciers and permanent snowfields on the Silver Divide and near the headwaters of Rock Creek On October only discontinuous patches of snow cover were present at very high elevations following the first snow storm of the season on September For investigations in hydrology and land surface climatology seasonal snow cover and alpine glaciers are critical to the radiation and water balances SIR C X SAR is a powerful tool because it is sensitive to most snowpack conditions and is less influenced by weather conditions than other remote sensing instruments such as Landsat In parallel with the operational SIR C data processing an experimental effort is being conducted to test SAR data processing using the Jet Propulsion Laboratory s massively parallel supercomputing facility centered around the Cray Research T D These experiments will assess the abilities of large supercomputers to produce high throughput SAR processing in preparation for upcoming data intensive SAR missions The images released here were produced as part of this experimental effort P October IMG SRC gif icons back yellow gif ALIGN BOTTOM Imaging Radar Home Page Updated bruce chapman jpl nasa gov
