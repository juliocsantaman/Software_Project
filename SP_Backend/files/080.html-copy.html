AIRSAR Compressed Stokes Matrix Data CM Description AIRSAR Compressed Stokes Matrix Data CM Description This manual is still being converted AIRSAR Data Compression Formats For AIRSAR data there are four possible formats compressed stokes matrix data multilook quad pol low res bytes pixel compressed scattering matrix processor data single look quad pol bytes pixel compressed scattering matrix processor data single look quad pol low res bytes pixel uncompressed synoptic amplitude data vax real single pol low res bytes pixel In the following descriptions sign will return the sign of the argument nint will indicate that the nearest integer value is calculated of its argument int will indicate that the truncation of the floating point value to integer is calculated of its argument and that if the floating point value is less than zero subtraction by is additionally required Note that this is not the same as FORTRAN int gen fac is the AIRSAR general scale factor whose value is recorded in the header of the oldheader field Stokes matrix data AIRSAR compressed Stokes matrix CM quad pol data bytes per pixel Consists of one file for each scene per frequency Each line of each file consists of azimuth samples There are or lines depending on the processor each corresponding to progressively greater range from the radar The azimuth pixel spacing is meters for the pre prf and meters for the and later prf The range pixel spacing is meters assumes MHz data The first two or three lines in the file are header lines The data has been symmetrized such that SHV SHV SVH and is usually calibrated For the processor the data has been multilooked by while for the processor the data has been multilooked by bytes per pixel quad pol data with Byte int log M Byte nint Mantissa Mantissa M Byte qsca gen fac Byte Byte Byte nint M qsca Byte nint sign M qsca sqrt M qsca Byte nint sign M qsca sqrt M qsca Byte nint sign M qsca sqrt M qsca Byte nint sign M qsca sqrt M qsca Byte nint M qsca Byte nint M qsca Byte nint M qsca The total power is TP M gen fac byte Byte The remaining terms are given by M M byte M sign byte M byte M sign byte M byte M sign byte M byte M sign byte M byte M M byte M M byte M M byte M M M M The difference between the AIRSAR CM data and SIR C MLC data is chiefly that for AIRSAR the elements of the Stokes Matrix are stored directly to each compressed byte while for SIR C the cross products that when combined appropriately comprise the Stokes matrix are stored In addition the AIRSAR data employs a general scale factor while SIR C does not And finally the value stored in the first two bytes by AIRSAR is the total power divided by the general scale factor while the value stored in the first two bytes by SIR C is four times the total power The Stokes matrix and Cross Products The symmetrized Stokes matrix may be formed from the cross products of the scattering matrix that are stored by SIR C in the MLC format as follows m ShhShh SvvSvv ShvShv m ShhShh SvvSvv m Re ShhShv Re ShvSvv m Im ShhShv Im ShvSvv m m m ShhShh SvvSvv ShvShv m Re ShhShv Re ShvSvv m Im ShhShv Im ShvSvv m m m m m ShvShv Re ShhSvv m Im ShhSvv m m m m m m m ShvShv Re ShhSvv The cross products in terms of the symmetrized Stokes matrix elements are ShhShh m m m m ShvShv m m SvvSvv m m m m ShhShv complex m m m m ShhSvv complex m m m ShvSvv complex m m m m For SLC data the Stokes matrix will not be symmetrized The unsymmetrized Stokes Matrix is given by m ShhShh ShvShv SvhSvh SvvSvv m ShhShh ShvShv SvhSvh SvvSvv m Re ShhShv Re SvhSvv m Im ShhShv Im SvhSvv m ShhShh ShvShv SvhSvh SvvSvv m ShhShh SvvSvv ShvShv SvhSvh m Re ShhShv Re SvhSvv m Im ShhShv Im SvhSvv m Re ShhSvh Re ShvSvv m Re ShhSvh Re ShvSvv m ShvShv Re ShhSvv m Im ShhSvv Im ShvSvh m Im ShhSvh Im ShvSvv m Im ShhSvh Im ShvSvv m Im ShhSvv Im ShvSvh m Re ShvSvh Re ShhSvv IMG SRC gif icons back yellow gif ALIGN BOTTOM Imaging Radar Home Page Updated bruce chapman jpl nasa gov
