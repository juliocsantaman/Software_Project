Spots Forever Origins of the Intelligence Cycle Date Tue Oct From wim pelt Subject MI targets Irish community in Britain Forwarded w o comment Tyrone man targeted at Heathrow BY MICK NAUGHTON SINN Fein s Francie Molloy has exposed another British undercover operation in London this week Molloy revealed that a young nationalist from the Coalisland area of east Tyrone has been hounded by British agents both at his home and workplace in Britain The man in his mid s who did not wish to be named for fear of losing his job first became suspicious last May as he returned to London from Tyrone where he had been attending his grandmother s funeral As he disembarked from a flight two men Chris and John struck up a conversation with him about the problems of getting regular work in London Both had what sounded like polite Belfast accents The Tyrone man who works at Heathrow airport s Terminal and who has lived in London for four years thought nothing more about the short encounter until he walked into his local bar weeks later to find the pair drinking together They reminded him of their earlier discussion After that the pair appeared regularly in a number of other places and on several occasions called to the man s home to get him out for a drink During conversation Chris and John told him they were thinking about opening a bar and asked if he would be interested in regular employment They pressed him repeatedly promising easier money The man s present job entails him doing hour shifts He said he wasn t interested However at the beginning of this week on Monday evening the pair s concentrated attention finally came to a head when Chris described as being of a heavy build declared they worked for the government and had access to huge sums of money The worried man speaking by phone to this reporter from a north London location on Tuesday morning related what happened next After telling me this they showed me a photograph clearly taken at my workplace in the airport at am this Monday morning They showed me another photo of my brother s former partner and they said they knew he had served time as a republican POW and was now working in England To be totally honest I was terrified they knew so much about my movements who my girlfriend was she comes originally from Co Kildare and information about my employer I was so nervous at being alone with them that I agreed to meet them at pm on Monday evening at a bar in Heathrow I was due to start my shift at pm so they clearly had checked this week s shifts arrangements Hailing a taxi they said they would leave me home as they didn t want something terrible to happen to me Chris then showed me an envelope full of bank notes but I refused to take it As they got out of the taxi Chris threw a A note laughing saying they would at least pay the taxi for now I told the driver to head on and stopped when they were out of sight Even though the fare was only a couple of pounds I gave the driver the A and asked him for a receipt which he signed I then took myself off phoned my employer and asked for a few days holiday I am very frightened rancie Molloy called to the young man s father s house in Tyrone that same night and talked with the British agent s victim by phone assuring him that he had notified human rights lawyer Gareth Peirce and an Irish based lawyer familiar with similar threats and approaches Molloy has also given him a contact number in London where he can be reached during Molloy s visit to London this week This is a disturbing case explained Molloy Over the past number of weeks other victims have come forward but requested no publicity Worringly these approaches have increased from the murder of Diarmuid O Neill on September It is clearly a signal from MI and other covert agencies that they are intent on targeting the Irish community in England What other shattered lives are they leaving by these heavy handed oppressive tactics I would appeal for anyone caught in a similar trap to contact a lawyer or public representative to document their activities Not to do so entails a life of manipulation and misery at the hands of a government dismissive of people s human rights RM Distribution an Irish Republican News and Information service http www irlnet com rmlist index html Date Tue Oct From jfloewen DIALUP FRANCENET FR Subject about Subscription

set to review by owner which means that no one can get your name Try it and test it Once again Subscription confirmation is a mechanism by LISTSERV by which the list is kept free from error addresses

you don t confirm AFTER YOU VE BEEN NOTIFIED I intended this to be a service to you Listserv will do this for all our benefit every three months Once again if you have questions please contact ME not
