Analysis of ACU Ratings of Congress Analysis of ACU Ratings of Congress A NOTE ON VOTE SELECTION Four categories of votes As the umbrella lobbying group of the conservative movement ACU tracks a wide range of issues before the Congress ranging from taxes to abortion from ballistic missile defenses to term limits Accordingly the votes we choose to rate are broken down into four general categories economic and budget matters social and cultural issues defense and foreign policy matters and issues of institutional reform We endeavor to analyze a roughly equal number of votes from each category so that we can obtain a comprehensive picture of an individual Member s ideological predisposition based on votes cast Votes rated on ideological distinction NOT quot most important quot Within those four broad areas ACU selects the votes it rates based on a simple criterion does the vote reflect a clear ideological distinction in the Congress Thus the votes we select to rate are not necessarily those considered the quot most important quot or the quot key quot votes of any given congressional session And they may not be votes we took a position or lobbied on during floor consideration They are chosen for one reason and one reason only to provide a clear picture of where individual Members of Congress stand on an ideological scale Thus for example the vote on NAFTA was not rated though it clearly was one of the most important votes of the session in terms of legislative impact The NAFTA vote was omitted from the ratings because it was not an ideologically driven vote many conservatives voted yes while a significant number of conservatives voted no Similarly many liberals voted no but a significant number voted yes This simple but important criterion is helpful in understanding any perceived differences between a Member s ACU rating and his or her rating from other organizations which provide ratings of Congress such as the AFL CIO the Christian Coalition or the Chamber of Commerce Vote breakdown For the first session of the th Congress we rated votes in the House and votes in the Senate In the House two votes were double weighted final passage on term limits and the Balanced Budget Act In the Senate one vote was double weighted the Balanced Budget Act The breakdown is as follows House Economic budget Social cultural Defense foreign policy Institutional Reform Senate Economic budget Social cultural Defense foreign policy Institutional Reform WHAT DO THE DATA SHOW Two types of analysis We did two types of analysis on the vote data the first a quot snapshot quot look at the Congress in the first session of the th Congress the second a quot moving picture quot look at vote trends over the last ten years th Congress more conservative The snapshot analysis reveals that the results of the elections in which Republicans took control of both House and Senate for the first time in four decades are reflected in the ideological vote patterns Both House and Senate showed significant increases in their quot conservative quotient quot as would be expected In the House there were perfect conservative scores of there were perfect liberal scores of Of the Republican freshmen there were perfect s thus though they represent less than one fifth of the entire House they accounted for just less than half of all the perfect s The most conservative Democrat in the House was Ralph Hall who scored a The most liberal Republican in the House was Connie Morella who scored a FYI Newt Gingrich scored a Dick Armey scored a Tom DeLay scored an John Boehner scored an Dick Gephardt scored a David Bonior scored a Vic Fazio scored an In the Senate there were perfect conservative scores of there were perfect liberal scores of The perfect conservative Senators were Kyl Smith Helms Faircloth Gramm Nickles and Inhofe The perfect liberal Senators were Boxer Inouye Akaka Sarbanes Levin Kerrey Lautenberg Bingaman Moynihan Leahy and Murray The most conservative Democrat in the Senate was a tie between Jim Exon and Fritz Hollings both of whom scored a The most liberal Republican in the Senate was Jim Jeffords who scored a FYI Bob Dole scored an Trent Lott scored a Thad Cochran scored an Don Nickles scored a Tom Daschle scored a Wendell Ford scored a Ted Kennedy scored a Chris Dodd scored a Congress becoming more ideologically polarized The moving picture analysis in which voting trends over the last ten years were analyzed provides evidence for the conventional wisdom that the Congress is becoming more polarized along ideological lines Republicans becoming more conservative Democrats more liberal In both House and Senate the analysis indicates that incoming freshman Republicans are voting more conservative than the departing Republicans and that incoming freshman Democrats are voting more liberal than the departing Democrats Use charts for elaboration Opposition provokes partisan and ideological unity A close analysis of the and vote patterns reveals interesting party unity scores In when the Democrats controlled the White House for the first time in years long suppressed liberal legislation came to the floor for votes Even liberal Republicans couldn t stomach some of this legislation and they voted with their more conservative Republican colleagues in opposition As a result party unity scores for Republicans were much higher than normal with most Republicans posting higher conservative scores than would otherwise have been expected In the exact opposite occurred with conservative legislation coming to the floor for the first time in four decades it was the Democrats who showed greater ideological unity in opposition thereby resulting in most Democrats posting higher liberal scores than would otherwise have been expected Meanwhile liberal Republicans fractured resulting in some scores for liberal Republicans that were even lower than usual
