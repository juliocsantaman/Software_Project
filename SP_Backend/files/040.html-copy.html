imaging radar system scheduled for launch aboard the NASA Space Shuttle in It consists of a radar antenna structure and associated radar system hardware that is designed to fit inside the Space Shuttle s cargo bay On take off the cargo bay doors are closed as seen in the graphic on the next page After the Space Shuttle has reached a stable Earth orbit the cargo bay doors will be opened the antenna structure will be deployed and SIR C X SAR will be switched on to begin using its state of the art radar technology to image the earth s surface Radar images generated by SIR C X SAR will be used by scientists to help understand some of the processes which affect the earth s environment such as deforestation in the Amazon desertification south of the Sahara and soil moisture retention in the Mid West Deploying SIR C Space Shuttle doors closed Space Shuttle doors open showing SIR C X SAR antenna The SIR C X SAR Project SIR C X SAR is a joint project of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA the German Space Agency DARA and the Italian Space Agency ASI It is the next step in a series of spaceborne imaging radars beginning with SEASAT in continuing with SIR A Germany s Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment and SIR B It is a precursor to the Earth Observing System EOS imaging radar system planned for the end of the decade Science Objectives SIR C X SAR s unique contributions to Earth observation and monitoring are its capability to measure from space the radar signature of the surface at three different wavelengths and to make measurements for different polarizations at two of those wavelengths SIR C image data will help scientists understand the physics behind some of the phenomena seen in radar images at just one wavelength polarization such as those produced by SEASAT Investigators on the SIR C X SAR Science team will use the radar image data from SIR C X SAR to make measurements of the following Vegetation type extent and deforestation Soil moisture content Ocean dynamics wave and surface wind speeds and directions Volcanism and tectonic activity Soil erosion and desertification SIR C X SAR Instrument Description The SIR C X SAR antenna structure actually consists of three individual antennas one operating at L band cm wavelength one at C band cm wavelength and the third at X band cm wavelength The L band and C band antennas are constructed from separate panels that can measure both horizontal and vertical polarizations The SIR C X SAR antenna is the most massive piece of hardware at a total of kilograms ever assembled at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and measures meters by meters The SIR C instrument was built by JPL and the Ball Communication Systems Division for NASA and provides the L band and C band measurements at different polarizations The L band and C band antennas employ phased array technology which allows the antenna beam pointing to be adjusted electronically The X SAR instrument is built by the Dornier and Alenia Spazio companies for DARA and ASI and operates at a single frequency X band The X SAR antenna is a slotted waveguide type which uses a mechanical tilt to change the beam pointing direction SIR C X SAR Image Data During a week long Shuttle flight SIR C X SAR will image an area of roughly million square kilometers of the Earth s surface This corresponds to a total of hours of data The peak data rate will be megabits or bits per second The data collected will be processed into images with resolution selectable from to meters The width of the area mapped out by the radar will vary from to kilometers depending on how the radar is operated and the direction in which the antenna beams are pointing Data from SIR C X SAR will be used to develop automatic techniques for extracting information from radar image data in preparation for the EOS SAR mission later in the decade This schematic diagram shows the SIR C X SAR antennas illuminating an area on the ground and mapping out a swath as the Shuttle moves forward The area shown is a SEASAT image of Los Angeles California North is to the right of the image shown More About SIR C X SAR The Shuttle Imaging Radar C and X Band Synthetic Aperture Radar SIR C X SAR is a cooperative space shuttle experiment between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASA the German Space Agency DARA and the Italian Space Agency ASI The experiment is the next step forward in NASA s Spaceborne Imaging Radar SIR program that began with the Seasat Synthetic Aperture Radar SAR in and continued with SIR A in and SIR B in The program will eventually lead to TOPSAT a mission to measure topography globally and the Earth Observing System EOS SAR later in this decade The program also benefits from experience gained with the Magellan Mission to Venus other international spaceborne radar programs e g ERS JERS and prototype aircraft sensors such as the JPL Airborne SAR AIRSAR SIR C will provide increased capability over SEASAT SIR A and SIR B by acquiring digital images simultaneously at two microwave wavelengths lambda L band lambda cm and C band lambda cm These vertically and horizontally polarized transmitted waves will be received on two separate channels so that SIR C will provide images of the magnitude of radar backscatter for four polarization combinations HH Horizontally transmitted Horizontally received VV Vertically transmitted Vertically received HV and VH and also data on the relative phase difference between the HH VV VH and HV returns This allows derivation of the complete scattering matrix of a scene on a pixel by pixel basis From this scattering matrix every polarization configuration linear circular or elliptical can be generated during ground processing The radar polarimetric data will yield more detailed information about the surface geometric structure vegetation cover and subsurface discontinuities than image brightness alone Germany s imaging radar program started with the Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment MRSE flown aboard the Shuttle This X band radar was flown on the first SPACELAB mission in The program was continued by development of the X SAR for which cooperation with Italy was initiated X SAR will operate at X band lambda cm with VV polarization resulting in a three frequency capability for the total SIR C X SAR system Because radar backscatter is most strongly influenced by objects comparable in size to the radar wavelength this multi frequency capability will provide information about the Earth s surface over a wide range of scales not discernible with previous single wavelength experiments SIR C X SAR Instrumentation SIR C will provide multi frequency multi polarization radar data The SIR C instrument is composed of several subsystems the antenna array the transmitter the receivers the data handling subsystem and the ground SAR processor The antenna is composed of two planar arrays one for L band and one for C band Each array is composed of a uniform grid of dual polarized microstrip antenna radiators with each polarization port fed by a separate corporate feed network The overall size of the SIR C antenna is x meters and consists of three leaves each divided into four subpanels Model of the SIR C X SAR antenna Unlike previous SIR missions the SIR C radar beam is formed from hundreds of small low power solid state transmitters embedded in the surface of the radar antenna By properly phasing the energy from these transmitters the beam can be electronically steered in the range direction deg from the nominal deg off nadir position without physically moving the large radar antenna This feature will enable images to be acquired over a wide range of incidence angles X SAR will provide VV polarization images using a passive slotted waveguide antenna measuring x meters Other X SAR components include a traveling wave tube as transmitter an exciter receiver and data handling subsystem A mechanical tilt mechanism will point the X SAR antenna to angles between and deg in the same direction as the L band and C band beams Both SIR C and X SAR can be operated as either stand alone radars or together Roll and yaw maneuvers of the shuttle will allow data to be acquired on either side of the shuttle nadir ground track The width of the imaged swath on the ground varies from to kilometers to miles depending on the orientation of the antenna beams and the operational mode Table presents a summary of the SIR C X SAR system characteristics Table SIR C X SAR System Characteristics
