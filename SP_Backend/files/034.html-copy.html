incorporating essential omega fatty acids by using cold pressed oils such as flax canola soybean or walnut in dressings When used as main dishes they can also include a light source of protein such as sprouted beans or nuts and seeds Selecting Vegetable Oils for Salads Extra virgin olive oil The full bodied first press without chemicals or heat is the best All other types are poorer quality and can be lighter in flavour Contains natural beta sistosterol vitamin E and other anti oxidants Does not need refrigeration Found in supermarkets or natural food stores Flax oil A great source of essential omega fatty acids for vegans or others who don t eat fish Available in natural food stores the best and richest form is cold pressed The container should be dark to minimize light peroxidation Look for the expiry date and always refrigerate or freeze for longer periods Cold pressed oils should not be heated excessively and are best used with salads and on cooked vegetables or grains The

other soy industries They have asked the Canadian government to allow this soy milk to be fortified with B zinc calcium and vitamin D With this industry supporting such a request we are likely to see
