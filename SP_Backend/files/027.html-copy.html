CIEC Response to DOJ Supreme Court Jurisdictional Statement No IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OCTOBER TERM JANET RENO ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES ET AL Appellants v AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION ET AL Appellees On Appeal from the United States District Court For the Eastern District of Pennsylvania RESPONSE OF APPELLEES AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ET AL TO APPELLANTS JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT Bruce J Ennis Jr Ann M Kappler Donald B Verrilli Jr John B Morris Jr JENNER amp BLOCK th Street N W Washington D C Counsel for American Library Assocation et al Appellees Counsel of Record Pursuant to Rule of the Rules of this Court appellees American Library Association et al respectfully submit this response to the government s jurisdictional statement INTRODUCTION During much of this century the mass media has been characterized by a limited number of speakers transmitting programming and information to essentially passive audiences The communications medium of the twenty first century the Internet and cyberspace generally is changing that and will allow hundreds of millions of individuals to engage in interactive communication on a national and global scale never before possible The public square of the past with pamphleteering soap boxes and vigorous debate is being replaced by the Internet which enables average citizens to participate in national discourse publish a newspaper distribute an electronic pamphlet to the world and generally to communicate to and with a broader audience than ever before possible It also enables average citizens to gain access to a vast and literally world wide range of information The Communications Decency Act quot CDA quot or the quot Act quot represents Congress first attempt to regulate speech content in this promising new medium Unfortunately Congress undertook this task without holding any hearings regarding the likely impact of the CDA on that medium In the name of protecting children from inappropriate material they might encounter online Congress clumsily attempted to graft regulations developed in the quot dial a porn quot context onto this very different indeed unique mode of communication After making precisely the kind of inquiry Congress failed to make that is undertaking five days of evidentiary hearings and considering massive amounts of documentary evidence including extensive stipulated facts the three judge district court below preliminarily enjoined enforcement of provisions of the CDA that effectively ban quot indecent quot and quot patently offensive quot communications between adults Appendix to Jurisdictional Statement quot J S App quot a a The district court unanimously held that appellees are likely to succeed in their claim that this ban violates the First Amendment That judgment was clearly correct Nevertheless appellees appreciate that this case raises important constitutional questions regarding the application of traditional First Amendment principles to a new and increasingly important medium of communication and therefore recognize that the Court is likely to grant plenary review regardless of the strength of the district court s decision Although we believe the judgment below could be summarily affirmed we understand that in this case of first impression the Court may prefer to engage in a more comprehensive examination of this new medium and of the extensive record compiled below We agree that in the circumstances of this case plenary review may be appropriate even if as we believe the judgment below is plainly correct Accordingly we do not oppose the government s request for plenary review However we do believe it is particularly important in this case of first impression that the Court have a clear understanding of precisely what was argued and decided below For example the government did not argue below as it apparently does here that Sections a B and d A of the CDA criminalize quot indecent quot or quot patently offensive quot speech only when the speaker knows that the only recipients of the speech are all under years of age Moreover the government s jurisdictional statement frequently ignores dispositive findings of fact the government does not argue are erroneous Accordingly we submit this response in order to present a more complete picture of what was and was not decided below COUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE A Plaintiffs Appellees in These Actions Appellees in these two consolidated cases represent a broad and very diverse spectrum of content providers service providers and users of content on the Internet The appellee content providers include individuals small non profit organizations libraries book stores and other speakers on the Internet The appellee access providers include small or non commercial quot Internet service providers quot quot ISPs quot as well as the world s leading ISPs and commercial online services Collectively appellees engage in or provide access to an enormous variety of speech on the Internet e g information about AIDS awareness classical and modern literature political commentary and interactive discussions on an array of topics All of this speech is appropriate and constitutionally protected for adults and the vast majority of this speech is appropriate and constitutionally protected for most minors as well Nevertheless appellees engage in or provide access to some speech that in some communities could be considered quot indecent quot or quot patently offensive quot Such speech includes communications that contain the quot seven dirty words quot found patently offensive in FCC v Pacifica Foundation U S information about sexual issues and problems and images that depict sexually oriented subjects Among this diverse group of appellee content providers most do not charge money for the speech they make available over the Internet some appellees provide and charge for access to the Internet or to an online service Thus users around the world generally can access appellees speech on the Internet free of charge Like other online speakers appellees generally seek to make their speech available to the broadest possible audience including listeners within and outside of the United States B The Three Judge District Court s Decision Appellants statement of the case entirely omits any reference to or discussion of the extensive and unusually detailed factual findings of the three judge district court that formed the foundation for the decision on appeal See J S App a a The Jurisdictional Statement fails to acknowledge the district court s critical factual findings that it is impossible or infeasible for most Internet speakers to comply with the CDA s affirmative defenses because of the global nature of the Internet the CDA will not effectively shield minors from indecent or patently offensive speech since a very substantial percentage of such speech is posted abroad and will not be deterred by the CDA and parents can use currently available software and access provider options to control what Internet sites their children may access These findings undergird the district court s legal conclusions that the Act effectively bans constitutionally protected speech among adults would not substantially further the government s stated interest in shielding minors from indecent online speech and is not the least restrictive means available to serve the government s interest Impossibility and infeasibility of compliance The district court received extensive evidence from numerous experts and other witnesses and carefully considered the different methods of communication over the Internet Based on this body of evidence the court made its general factual finding that quot o nce a provider posts content on the Internet it is available to all other Internet users worldwide quot J S App a For most methods of communication over the Internet the court concluded that it simply is not possible for a speaker to restrict the availability of his or her speech to adults For example the district court specifically considered the ability of a speaker posting a message to a USENET newsgroup to comply with the CDA The court found that messages on newsgroups are quot disseminated using ad hoc peer to peer connections between approximately computers called USENET servers around the world quot J S App a and that the quot dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the world is an automated process that does not require direct human intervention or review quot id at a a Because of this structure the court found as a fact that quot once a user posts a message to a newsgroup that message becomes available to all subscribers to that newsgroup or bulletin board quot Id at a As the court below found content posted to newsgroups is quot available not just in Philadelphia but also in Provo and Prague quot Id at a The court specifically further found that quot individuals posting a message to a newsgroup cannot ensure that all readers are adults quot Id at a emphasis added noting that even the government s expert agreed with that factual conclusion The district court reached the same conclusions about e mail mail exploders also known as listservs chat rooms and MUDs and MUSEs The court found as a fact that there is quot no effective way to determine the identity or age of a user who is accessing material through e mail mail exploders newsgroups or chat rooms quot J S App a With regard to mail exploders the district court specifically noted that even the government s expert witness quot agreed that no current technology could give a speaker assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail exploder s mailing list quot Id at a As with newsgroups and mail exploders the court based its finding that individuals quot engaging in chat room discussions cannot ensure that all readers are adults quot in part on the fact that the government s expert agreed Id Similarly with MUDs and MUSEs the court found as a fact that quot participants do not know whether the other participants are adults or minors quot Id at a With respect to the World Wide Web which is one method of communication on the Internet the court found that quot u nlike other forms of communication on the Internet quot J S App a there does exist quot technology by which an operator of a World Wide Web server may interrogate a user of a Web site quot using a computer program called a quot cgi script quot id The court found as a fact however that content providers who publish on the World Wide Web via the large commercial online services cannot use cgi scripts Id For those speakers on the Web there quot is no method currently available to screen recipients online for age quot Id The court concluded that all of the quot defenses quot advanced by the government below quot are effectively unavailable for non commercial not for profit entities quot J S App a and these entities constitute the majority of speakers on the Internet See id at a a For example the distinct court found as a fact that quot credit card verification is effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers as a potential defense to the CDA quot Id at a The district court similarly considered the quot adult verification quot defense and found as a fact that the quot burdens imposed by credit card verification and adult password verification systems make them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers quot Id at a Finally the district court found as a fact that the government s quot tagging quot proposal would not allow a speaker to ensure that a listener is not a minor Id at a a Chief Judge Sloviter summarized the court s factual conclusions as follows we have found that no technology exists which allows those posting protected but indecent material on the category of newsgroups mail exploders or chat rooms to screen for age Speakers using those forms of communication cannot control who receives the communication and in most instances are not aware of the identity of the recipients If it is not feasible for speakers who communicate via these forms of communication to conduct age screening they would have to reduce the level of communication to that which is appropriate for children in order to be protected under the statute This would effect a complete ban even for adults of some expression albeit quot indecent quot to which they are constitutionally entitled Even as to content providers in the other broad category such as the World Wide Web where efforts at age verification are technically feasible through the use of Common Gateway Interface cgi scripts the Findings of Fact show that as a practical matter non commercial organizations and even many commercial organizations using the Web would find it prohibitively expensive and burdensome to engage in the methods of age verification proposed by the government and that even if they could attempt to age verify there is little assurance that they could successfully filter out minors J S App a In their Findings of Fact the three judges below found as facts that Many speakers who display arguably indecent content on the Internet must choose between silence and the risk of prosecution The CDA s defenses credit card verification adult access codes and adult personal identification numbers are effectively unavailable for non commercial not for profit entities J S App a emphasis added Ineffectiveness of the CDA The district court also made specific factual findings demonstrating that because a substantial percentage of all of the indecent or patently offensive speech that is available on the Internet is posted abroad the CDA will not be effective in its claimed goal of preventing children from accessing that material The court found that a quot large percentage perhaps or more quot of content on the Internet quot originates outside of the United States quot J S App a and some of that foreign speech is sexually explicit id As the court found quot f oreign content is otherwise indistinguishable from domestic content as long as it is in English since foreign speech is created named and posted in the same manner as domestic speech quot Id Minors would have unfettered access to all indecent or patently offensive speech posted abroad and thus as Judge Dalzell concluded quot the CDA will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government s interest in shielding children from pornography on the Internet quot Id at a Availability of user software to block or screen material on the Internet Finally the government s Jurisdictional Statement entirely omits any mention of the extensive factual findings of the district court concerning the variety of methods by which parents can easily and inexpensively prevent their children from accessing indecent or patently offensive online content even if posted overseas The court identified many different and currently available software programs that allow parents to limit the Internet access of their children J S App a a Similarly the court found that the major online services all offer extensive options to allow parents to control what their children can access Id at a a Given these factual findings which the government has not contested it is clear that the three judge district court correctly held that plaintiffs had demonstrated a likelihood of success on their claim that the challenged provisions of the CDA violate the First Amendment ARGUMENT I THE DISTRICT COURT S PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION SHOULD BE AFFIRMED BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT CONTESTED THE FACTS ON WHICH THAT INJUNCTION IS BASED AND DOES NOT ASK THE COURT TO OVERRULE THE LONG ESTABLISHED FIRST AMENDMENT PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THAT INJUNCTION IS BASED As noted the government does not argue that the district court s findings of fact are arbitrary or otherwise erroneous Nor does the government question the First Amendment principles invoked by the district court Accordingly the government is simply challenging the application of settled First Amendment principles to undisputed findings of fact A The Government Does Not Question the District Court s Conclusion That the CDA Must Be Subjected to Strict Scrutiny The government does not dispute that the district court appropriately subjected the CDA s content based restrictions to strict scrutiny See Jurisdictional Statement quot J S quot Its sole argument is that the Act can be upheld under strict scrutiny because the Act quot directly and materially quot serves a quot compelling quot government interest in the quot least restrictive quot way Id citing Sable Communications of Cal Inc v FCC U S Accord Turner Broadcasting System v FCC S Ct The government relies as it did below on its interest in protecting children from quot patently offensive quot and quot indecent quot sexually oriented online material See J S App a Sloviter J a Dalzell J But the government also invents a new interest never advanced below quot furthering the First Amendment interests of all parents and children in using what has become an unparalleled tool for communicating and retrieving information quot J S Without citation to the record the government now asserts as if it were a matter of fact that unless quot patently offensive quot and quot indecent quot material is suppressed at the speaker end quot many parents will be deterred from permitting their children to use the Internet indeed many parents will be deterred from bringing the Internet into their homes at all quot Id The government introduced no evidence to support these assertions of fact And not surprisingly the district court was not asked to and did not make any such findings Thus nothing in the record supports the assertion that the Act directly and substantially furthers this newly coined interest In any event it makes little difference what interest the government now asserts in attempting to justify the Act s ban on protected speech The district court correctly concluded that the Act cannot survive the strict scrutiny to which it must be subjected B The District Court Correctly Concluded That Appellees Had Established a Likelihood of Success on Their Claim That the Challenged CDA Provisions Are Facially Unconstitutional Although the government now attempts to separate out and defend individually the three substantive provisions of the CDA preliminarily enjoined by the district court this is not how the case was argued and tried below To the contrary the government made no attempt to distinguish between the three provisions essentially conceding the same First Amendment analysis applies to all three The entire focus of the case from the perspective of not only the court but the parties as well was the feasibility of the CDA s defenses and the Act s patent overbreadth To the extent any one provision received attention it was the quot display quot provision U S C d B That provision criminalizes the online display of patently offensive material quot in a manner available quot to minors The vast majority of the speech criminalized by the CDA perhaps of the speech at issue in this litigation is criminalized by that provision That provision unquestionably violates the First Amendment as both the three judge court below and the Shea court unanimously held The Display Provision Imposes a Criminal Ban on Constitutionally Protected Speech Contrary to Well settled First Amendment Precedent As the government essentially concedes the challenged provisions of the CDA are clearly unconstitutional unless the Act s defenses effectively enable online speakers to communicate indecent or patently offensive speech to adults See J S That is so because this Court has repeatedly held that government may not ban indecent speech between adults in order to advance its interest in protecting minors from that speech To the contrary quot government may not reduce the adult population to only what is fit for children quot quot The level of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for a sandbox quot and this is so quot regardless of the strength of the government s interest quot in protecting children Bolger v Youngs Drug Products Corp U S emphasis added Government may not constitutionally quot quarantin e the general reading public against books not too rugged for grown men and women in order to shield juvenile innocence Surely this is to burn the house to roast the pig quot Butler v Michigan U S In Sable the Court cited Butler to quot reiterate quot that point and stressed that a federal statute is unconstitutional if it has the quot effect of limiting the content of adult communications to that which is suitable for children quot U S at emphasis added See also Denver Area Educ Telecomm Consortium v FCC S Ct noting that quot n o provision we concede short of an absolute ban can offer certain protection against assault by a determined child quot and affirming that the Court has quot not however generally allowed this fact alone to justify reduc ing the adult population to only what is fit for children quot internal quotations omitted id at Kennedy amp Ginsburg J J concurring in part and dissenting in part same For this reason the government s entire case hinges on the availability of the Act s defenses But as the district court unanimously concluded based on its extensive findings of fact which the government has not contested the defenses simply are not available to the vast majority of online speakers As a result the Act does effect a ban on constitutionally protected speech between adults The government s arguments to the contrary are based on factual assertions that find no support in the record a First the government argues that the Act s credit card and adult ID defense is available to the small subset of online speakers who charge for access to their Web sites so called quot commercial quot providers J S The government introduced limited evidence that certain commercial quot pornographers quot already use credit cards or adult ID verification systems But as Judge Dalzell explained these providers will be largely unaffected by the Act precisely because they already require credit cards to obtain access to virtually all of their posted content Even if the Act were struck down commercial pornographers would continue to require credit cards as they did before the CDA was enacted because they do not want to provide their speech for free To the extent they offer advertising quot teasers quot free of charge the Act would require them to charge for those images as well but the Act s vast burden on protected speech cannot be upheld based on this minuscule subset of applications in which the credit card defense could arguably be invoked See J S App a Dalzell J Far from advancing the government s interest quot in a direct and material way quot Turner S Ct at such narrow application quot provides only the most limited incremental support for the interest asserted quot Bolger U S at The government s suggestion that the district court should have rewritten Section d B so that it would apply only to these quot commercial pornographers quot see J S contradicts the statutory text and clearly expressed congressional intent As Judge Sloviter concluded below quot i t is clear from the face of the CDA and from its legislative history that Congress did not intend to limit its application to commercial purveyors of pornography quot J S App a Accord Shea F Supp at Unlike the dial a porn restrictions upon which the CDA is purportedly modeled the CDA is not by its terms limited to quot commercial quot speakers And the Conference Report confirms that Congress intended quot content regulation of both commercial and non commercial providers quot H R Conf Rep No th Cong d Sess Indeed the Act is expressly made applicable to quot libraries and educational institutions quot U S C e And Senator Exon the main sponsor of the Act referred to newsgroups which contain primarily non commercial speech as the principal target of the legislation See Cong Rec S daily ed June The district court thus correctly declined to perform the quot radical surgery quot on the CDA the government suggests Further the government ignores the district court s factual finding that the credit card defense quot would impose a significant economic cost on non commercial entities quot J S App a Forcing speakers to require credit card verification before providing access to their speech would cause many speakers including many appellees to quot shut down quot their Web sites Id Credit card verification the court found also quot would significantly delay the retrieval of information on the Internet quot which as the government s expert acknowledged would deter many listeners from seeking access at all Id And it quot would completely bar adults who do not have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from accessing any blocked material quot Id Based on the evidence the court concluded that quot a t this time credit card verification is effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers as a potential defense to the CDA quot Id The government has not challenged these critical findings b Ignoring the district court s express findings to the contrary the government contends that noncommercial Web sites can take advantage of the Act s defenses and complains that the court did not adequately discuss the availability of quot adult verification services quot such as quot AdultCheck quot J S The reason is simple The government offered quot very limited evidence quot regarding age verification systems and even that limited evidence quot was not based on personal knowledge quot J S App a There was no evidence how many persons are registered with such systems or how reliable they are in screening by age Id There was evidence however that adult verification systems are used to the extent they are used at all only quot for accessing commercial pornographic sites which charge users for their services quot Id Appellees and their potential listeners obviously would not want to be associated with verification systems that are used primarily if not exclusively to access quot pornographic quot sites See Denver Area S Ct at quot written notice quot requirement will restrict cable viewing by subscribers who quot fear for their reputations quot if it were disclosed they view quot patently offensive quot material There are no such verification systems for the vast majority of speech on the Internet including the speech of the appellees in these consolidated cases The government s contention now that such systems may be available as a defense for commercial speakers who are not quot pornographers quot and for the huge number of noncommercial speakers is thus entirely unsupported by the record To the contrary the district court found as fact that quot i t would not be feasible for many non commercial organizations to design their own adult access code screening systems because the administrative burden of creating and maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs involved is beyond their reach quot J S App a Indeed even some quot commercial quot entities could not afford to do so Id Moreover there was evidence that some Web users would not retrieve information requiring credit cards or adult IDs Id Most importantly as the court found quot the g overnment presented no testimony as to how such systems could ensure that the user of the password or credit card is in fact over quot Id at a The government has not directly challenged and has certainly offered no basis for overturning the district court s factual finding that quot t he burdens imposed by credit card verification and adult password verification systems make them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers quot Id c Finally with not a single citation to the record or to the district court s findings the government baldly contends that mail exploder chat room and newsgroup users who want to disseminate patently offensive material to adults can comply with the Act J S This contention is fatally undermined by the district court s factual findings The court concluded based on the record evidence that quot t here is no effective way to determine the identity or the age of a user who is accessing material through e mail mail exploders newsgroups or chat rooms quot J S App a Indeed as the district court noted the government s own expert agreed with those findings Id at a Despite its current speculation in the district court quot t he government offered no evidence that there is a reliable way to ensure that recipients and participants in such fora can be screened for age quot Id emphasis added It is thus not surprising that the government ultimately concedes that users of mail exploders newsgroups and chat rooms who want to disseminate their constitutionally protected speech will be forced by the CDA to quot switch to an alternative method of communicating that material over the Internet or otherwise quot J S But requiring speakers to switch to an alternative method is patently unconstitutional particularly since there is no realistic alternative in terms of cost or audience reach to communication over the Internet The government can no more single out a mode of Internet communication for special bans or burdens than it can single out one mode of the press See Arkansas Writers Project Inc v Ragland U S And in any event the fact that speech can occur elsewhere cannot justify a content based restriction Southeastern Promotions v Conrad U S Schneider v State U S Even more offensive to the First Amendment the government suggests that quot users of all three forms of communication always have the option to tone down their communication so that it does not contain material quot criminalized by the Act J S In other words they can self censor their speech in order to avoid federal prosecution There could be no clearer admission that the CDA s quot display quot provision imposes a ban on the dissemination of constitutionally protected speech All Three Challenged Provisions Fail Strict Scrutiny Because They Do Not Directly and Substantially Advance Any Compelling Government Interest In any event even if the majority of Internet speakers could utilize the CDA s defenses and they cannot the Act would still fail strict scrutiny for the independent reason not addressed by the government here that because of the global nature of the Internet the Act cannot and will not directly and substantially further the government s stated interest The district court found as fact that quot a large percentage perhaps or more of content on the Internet originates outside the United States quot J S App a accord Shea F Supp at The government conceded below that some of the speech posted abroad would violate the CDA J S App a and it is likely that at least of all speech criminalized by the Act originates outside the United States Moreover the subset of indecent and patently offensive speech the government found most troubling and asserted is the focus of the CDA namely sexually oriented visual images is generic and largely fungible Its country of origin is irrelevant From the perspective of its potential interest to and or effect on minors a photo of a nude woman posted in Denmark is no different from a photo of a nude woman posted in the United States And both are equally available to every American home connected to the Internet As the district court concluded quot p ornography from say Amsterdam will be no less appealing to a child on the Internet than pornography from New York City quot J S App a Dalzell J Because foreign speakers will have little or no incentive to comply with the Act quot the CDA will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government s interest in shielding children from pornography on the Internet quot Id See also Shea F Supp at concluding that the CDA quot will not reach a significant percentage of the sexually explicit material currently available quot In fact if the Act were upheld thus criminalizing domestic speech that would simply quot encourage American pornographers to relocate in foreign countries or at least use anonymous remailers from foreign servers quot J S App a n Dalzell J Under strict scrutiny and even under intermediate scrutiny the government must demonstrate that the Act quot will in fact alleviate the harms it is meant to prevent in a direct and material way quot Turner S Ct at The CDA s inability to regulate foreign speakers precludes any such showing See e g Denver Area S Ct at quot Partial service of a compelling interest is not narrow tailoring quot Kennedy amp Ginsburg J J concurring in part and dissenting in part Florida Star v BJF U S holding that Florida law prohibiting disclosure of rape victims names in quot any instrument of mass communication quot but not by other means did not directly and substantially further the law s stated purpose Smith v Daily Mail Publishing Co U S invalidating law making it a crime for newspaper but not electronic media to publish the names of juvenile offenders see also Bolger U S at restriction that quot provides only the most limited incremental support for the interest asserted quot cannot pass muster under commercial speech standards As Justice Scalia explained in Florida Star quot a law cannot be regarded as justifying a restriction upon truthful speech when it leaves appreciable damage to th e government s supposedly vital interest unprohibited quot U S at Scalia J concurring This fundamental shortcoming of the Act exists regardless of whether the online communication is specifically and intentionally directed to minors or is simply displayed in a manner available to them in either event the CDA will not shield minors from foreign originating material The Act s ineffectiveness is therefore a separate and independent reason for affirming the district court s preliminary injunction as to all three of the CDA s substantive restrictions regardless of how broadly or narrowly they are construed See pp infra The Act Fails Strict Scrutiny Because There Are Less Restrictive Means to Achieve the Government s Stated Goals Underlying the government s argument is a single premise that without the Act minors would be left quot wholly unprotected quot J S See also id at arguing that there is quot no other effective way to vindicate the government s compelling interests quot But that premise is simply not true Indeed it is completely undermined by the district court s findings of fact based largely on government stipulations The district court concluded that quot market forces exist to limit the availability of material on line that parents consider inappropriate for their children quot J S App a n The district court made extensive factual findings regarding the availability of quot software that is intended to enable parents and other adults to limit the Internet access of children quot Id at a The court noted that quot t he market for this type of software is growing and there is increasing competition among software providers to provide products quot Id The court went on to make specific findings regarding two such products Cyber Patrol and SurfWatch Id at a a The court also found that all of the major commercial Internet access providers America Online AOL Microsoft Network CompuServe and Prodigy quot offer parental control options free of charge to their members quot and made specific findings regarding those parental control mechanisms Id at a a Each of these findings was based on facts stipulated by the government The court also discussed PICS the quot Platform for Internet Content Selection quot which has developed quot technical standards that would support parents ability to filter and screen material that their children see on the Web quot Id at a PICS provides the ability for third parties as well as individual content providers to rate material Parents can then screen their children s Internet access based on the rating system they choose Indeed they can screen out all speech that has not been affirmatively identified as appropriate for children by a rating bureau the parents trust Id These findings too were stipulated by the government Based on these stipulated facts and the additional evidence it heard at trial the court concluded that quot currently available user based software suggests that a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent their children from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may believe is inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available quot J S App a As Judge Dalzell explained these software tools afford parents options to protect their children from online material they deem inappropriate J S App a But even without such software quot parents can supervise their children s use of the Internet or deny their children the opportunity to participate in the medium until they reach an appropriate age quot Id The government can support parents by educating the public about the quot benefits and dangers of this new medium quot Id See Denver Area S Ct at concluding that quot informational requirements quot together with support for user based blocking is a more narrowly tailored means of limiting minors access to patently offensive material on cable than is speaker based blocking In other sections of the CDA Congress determined that user based blocking mechanisms are the most appropriate means of regulating content including indecency on broadcast television In Section of the Act Congress directed television manufacturers to equip their products quot with a feature designed to enable viewers to block display of all programs with a common rating quot the so called quot V chip quot Sec c Congress then encouraged the broadcast industry to develop a rating system Sec b and expressly stated federal policy to encourage the establishment of a quot technology fund quot to support the development of user based blocking technology and public education Sec The fact that Congress has chosen these significantly less restrictive means to protect minors from indecent material in broadcast television further supports the district court s holding that the Act is not narrowly tailored See Denver Area S Ct at unexplained decision to use quot significantly less restrictive quot means to shield minors from quot patently offensive quot material on regular cable channels demonstrated that restrictions applicable to leased channels is neither the quot least restrictive alternative quot nor quot narrowly tailored quot C The Non Display Provisions of the CDA Preliminarily Enjoined by the District Court May Pose Different Questions If They Are Construed As the Government Now Apparently Construes Them on Appeal The government did not argue below that Sections a B and d A only criminalize the transmission of quot indecent quot or quot patently offensive material quot when the speaker knows that the only recipient of the communication is under years of age The government now contends for the first time that Section a B quot applies only in situations in which a person transmits indecent material to another person knowing that person is under quot J S emphasis added If we understand the government correctly it is now interpreting Section a B to apply only when the only recipient of a communication is known to be a minor Below all parties assumed that Section a B could and would be interpreted to criminalize any indecent communications using a telecommunications device when the speaker knew or had reason to believe that any recipient of the communication would be a minor Since every content provider on the World Wide Web for example knows in the sense of being virtually certain that some recipient of the message will be a minor Section a B creates the same constitutional problems barring speech between adults in order to shield minors from the same speech as the display provision Accordingly it is not surprising that the district court applied the same First Amendment analysis to the non display provisions and unanimously concluded that the quot p laintiffs have established a reasonable probability of eventual success in the litigation by demonstrating that a B and a of the CDA are unconstitutional on their face to the extent that they reach indecency quot J S App a Although the government now asserts that the display provision and the other provisions quot require separate analysis quot J S it did not urge any separate analysis below See note supra Based on the arguments that were made to the district court its conclusion regarding a was clearly correct The government also now for the first time interprets Section d A as applying only to quot situations in which a person sends indecent material to someone he knows to be under quot J S It is not at all clear that this is a tenable interpretation of Section d A which unlike Section a B does not expressly impose a scienter requirement regarding age If we understand the government correctly it is now interpreting Section d A to apply to a communication with specific persons where the speaker knows that the only persons receiving the message are minors Below all parties assumed that Section d A could and would be interpreted to reach any quot patently offensive quot communication knowingly made using an interactive computer service where the speaker sent the message to specific persons such as by e mail or mail exploders as opposed to methods of online communication in which the speaker merely makes his speech available to anyone who wants to access it such as through the World Wide Web Under this interpretation Section d A imposes virtually the same restrictions on adult to adult communications as does the display provision and presents the same constitutional problems Not surprisingly the district court unanimously concluded that quot Sections d and d of the CDA are unconstitutional on their face quot J S App a Based on the arguments made to the district court this conclusion was clearly correct In summary the display provision clearly violates the First Amendment because it bans quot patently offensive quot but constitutionally protected speech between adults As understood and argued below the other provisions suffer from the same infirmity If the government is now definitively and officially construing those other provisions to apply only when the speaker knows that the only recipients of the speech are minors this Court should not itself undertake to review ab initio the constitutionality of these newly coined provisions Instead it should allow the district court to reassess those provisions on remand in light of the government s new position CONCLUSION Although the judgment below was plainly correct and would warrant summary affirmance because this is a case of first impression involving application of First Amendment principles to an important new medium of

by the CDA because only user based blocking will prevent minors from accessing the substantial percentage of all indecent speech that is posted abroad And unlike speaker based blocking which effectively prohibits adults from gaining access to the blocked speech user based blocking enables parents to gain access to the speech themselves while denying access to their children Two judges also concluded that the CDA is unconstitutionally vague In particular Judges Sloviter and Buckwalter agreed that the terms quot indecent quot and quot patently offensive quot quot in context quot are so vague as to violate the First and Fifth Amendments J S App a Sloviter J a a Buckwalter J These judges were clearly correct notwithstanding this Court s distinguishable decision in Denver Area Educ Telecomm Consortium Inc v FCC S Ct however because the district court s decision can and should be affirmed on the basis of its First Amendment holding there is no need for the Court to reach the vagueness issue The government wisely has not resurrected its argument suggested but not seriously urged below that an quot intermediate scrutiny quot standard drawn from FCC v Pacifica Found U S might be appropriate instead Clearly such a standard is not applicable here where there is no plausible analogy to the spectrum scarcity of broadcast the Internet s characteristics are the antithesis of the scarcity that underlies the Pacifica standard See Turner S Ct at refusing to extend Pacifica standard to cable television Sable U S at same regarding dial a porn services Nor is the Internet characterized by the pervasiveness and intrusiveness the Pacifica Court found noteworthy about broadcast As the district court found accessing online content requires several affirmative steps quot c ommunications over the Internet do not invade an individual s home or appear on one s computer screen unbidden quot J S App a Moreover quot a lmost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to the content quot Id Thus as the government s witness admitted quot the odds are slim that a user would come across a sexually explicit site by accident quot Id In the context of strict scrutiny the Court should consider only the precise interests the government identified and urged below as the justification for the law it should not credit new interests advanced only on appeal and as to which the court below had no opportunity to take evidence or pass upon Cf Edenfield v Fane S Ct In any event the government cites no legal support and there is none for the proposition that assisting parents or children to use the Internet is a quot compelling quot government interest Indeed as the government itself notes J S the evidence shows that the number of minors gaining access to the Internet is rapidly increasing And to the extent parents are concerned about their children s access to inappropriate materials the district court found that user based technological tools are available to assist them in imposing restrictions J S App a See note infra and accompanying text Below the government s only specific argument regarding U S C a was relegated to a footnote quot The specific basis for plaintiffs challenge to section a is unclear In the absence of a specific showing as to how this provision is applicable and might be in violation of the Constitution it should not be enjoined quot Defendant s Opposition to Plaintiffs Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order Feb at n The government made no specific arguments below regarding U S C d A and otherwise referred to U S C a and d together throughout its papers The government tacitly acknowledges the weakness of its argument that Section d B can survive strict scrutiny when it states that the constitutional issues posed by that provision are quot more difficult quot than those posed by Sections a and d A J S Sable Communications v FCC U S at quoting from Bolger v Youngs Drug Products Corp U S which in turn quoted from Butler v Michigan U S Thus this bedrock principle has already been applied in the context of sale or distribution of immoral books and other printed materials Butler use of the postal service to mail unsolicited commercial advertisements about contraceptives to homes Bolger and use of the telephone to sell sexually explicit communications Sable If as the government has suggested the CDA was principally aimed at commercial providers of online quot pornography quot Congress could have passed a statute aimed specifically at that activity Cf Zauderer v Office of Disciplinary Counsel U S government may not enact a broad prophylactic rule quot simply to spare itself the trouble quot of distinguishing speech that is the subject of legitimate regulatory concern from speech that is not There was no evidence that the amount of indecent and patently offensive speech as a percentage of the whole varies depending on its country of origin For the same reason the CDA will not directly and substantially further the government s newly found interest in expanding access to the Internet Because foreign quot patently offensive quot and quot indecent quot online material will remain available to their children parents under the government s theory will continue to be deterred from permitting their children to use the Internet Of course even under this interpretation the provision could still senselessly and indeed unconstitutionally outlaw a college professor s communications concerning Lady Chatterly s Lover or Moll Flanders for example to a student known to be
