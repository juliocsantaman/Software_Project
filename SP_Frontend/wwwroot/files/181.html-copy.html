SIGNPOSTS POINT WAY TOWARD INDUSTRY TRENDS OF Executive Summary From interviews with industry leaders and analysis of recent events it is possible to connect some of the dots and make educated guesses about what holds in store for wireless The way Larry Vanston sees it the year ahead will be a lot like in the world of wireless telecommunications This is to say that will be another year of record setting growth heightened competition and rapid techno logical change for the industry according to Vanston president of Austin Texas based consultants Technology Futures Inc Vanston and other observers surveyed by WB F said it may well be that the industry is in for a year when the pace of developments if anything gains more momentum Such an acceleration is seen occurring across a broad front mani fested by prices for services driven lower as more competitors arrive on the scene and by a stream of technological advances and against a backdrop where wireless telephony becomes a widespread reality in more markets overseas But this is not to say that there are no clouds on the wireless horizon Indeed renewed signs of a slowdown in the U S cellular market the world s largest in terms of absolute subscribers have dampened the growth outlook for network operators and for handset and infrastructure manufacturers As Nokia Corp noted Dec Despite improvement in Nokia s U S mobile phone business growth and profitability in Nokia Mobile Phones have developed somewhat below plan That sent the price of Nokia s American Depositary Receipts tumbling for the second time in two months page However it was unclear at press time whether handset manufacturers in general faced a repeat of the overages that built up in their U S inventories during the Christmas season All the same Wall Streeters are a notoriously fickle bunch and any fall off in domestic wireless growth should be measured against the blistering ex pansion that the U S market enjoyed during and the first half of Net subscriber additions simply could not be sustained forever at such an ex plosive rate and cellular s long term growth pattern seems firmly intact By the end of it is conceivable that there will be million cellu lar subscribers in the United States a gain of million in a month span All Eyes Turn to PCS Big changes are destined to sweep the U S wireless market this year as the industry comes to grips with the probable enactment of legislation aimed at deregulating telecommunications This would give network operators the statu tory certainty they need to move forward with big purchases of new equipment said Matthew Flanagan president of the Telecommunications Industry Association Arlington Va Moreover the U S market is on the verge of entering a new phase with the advent of broadband personal communications services PCS It may be another year yet before PCS is marketed on a large scale but PCS licensees are betting big bucks that both lower price points and the digitally enhanced sound quality of calls placed over their systems will prove appealing to consumers who have disdained cellular as too costly and to at least some cellular subscribers This year s challenges for PCS players will be to finish the U S licensing process the C block spectrum auction see page is set to resume this week and to bring newly licensed services to market said Tom Mateer vice president of business development for Sprint Telecommunications Venture STV the al liance of Sprint Corp and three large cable television operators Our goal is to provide service in our own markets by the end of Mateer said of Kansas City based STV the largest of the A B block major trading area MTA licensees in terms of potential market population Other MTA licensees including AT T Wireless Services and PCS PrimeCo L P are working against similar timetables While committed to code division multiple access CDMA as its technology standard STV had not named equipment vendors for its network buildout estimated to cost from billion to billion by industry sources at press time Mateer said talks with prospective suppliers were moving along Some funds from Sprint s long anticipated deal to sell percent equity interests to France Telecom and Germany s Deutsche Telekom which was approved by the FCC last month are expected to be earmarked for STV s buildout On the narrowband side of PCS action will center on how successfully competitors narrow the lead that Mobile Telecommunication Technologies Corp Mtel enjoys in this market For its part Mtel continues to grapple with what Alex Brown Sons Inc recently called rollout concerns surrounding the company s SkyTel Way advanced messaging service Competition Consolidation and Convergence More of the Same Only More So Perhaps the most important issue before the wireless industry is how to compete effectively on a landscape that seemingly keeps shifting beneath its feet For many wireless players achieving scale is the way to maximize their competitive ability This consolidation trend has been most pronounced in paging where Arch Communications Group Inc and AirTouch Paging announced the most recent acquisitions deals giving them about million and million U S subscribers respectively Suf fice it to say that more paging acqui sitions are in the offing this year But will see the introduction of new wireless players as well via corporate spinoffs For instance Sprint s spinoff of its Sprint Cellular subsidiary to shareholders WB F June is on track for completion late next month or early in March and AT T Corp s landmark breakup WB F Sept is set to close by year s end Other wireless companies may become publicly held entities PageMart Inc the only privately held company among the top U S paging operators has hinted that it may go this route and London financial circles are abuzz that Hutchison Wampoa of Hong Kong will float Orange its U K personal communications network PCN possibly as part of a larger realignment of its telecom interests And the cast of characters getting into wireless seems likely to keep on growing Two recent examples A unit of International Family Entertainment Inc whose chairman is evangelist Pat Robertson bought out the majority interest held by Motorola Inc in Pakistan Mobile Communications Ltd licensed to offer nationwide cellular service based on the global system for mobile communications GSM standard as well as paging in the Asian country Fidelity Capital part of the Boston based mutual funds giant has helped engineer a deal aimed at strengthening specialized mobile radio SMR operator Pittencrieff Communications Inc in its core Texas market WB F May Pittencrieff shareholders were to vote late this week on the company s merger with Fidelity owned Advanced MobileComm Inc Meanwhile convergence has continued to take on new and different forms in wireless For instance there is the growing trend among competition minded service providers to establish themselves as one stop shops In the space of a week last month Dallas based Paging Network Inc PageNet announced marketing agreements with both STV and GTE Corp giving PageNet new distribution channels for its digital and alphanumeric services in both the PCS and local telephone markets respectively STV by packaging cable services on a promotional basis with its planned service offerings for the local and long distance telephone markets appears to be seeking as many distribution sources as possible STV also signed an agree ment covering various text messaging services with National Dispatch Center Inc a San Diego based data network operator last month Technology It s Show Time for CDMA iDEN Technology like competition is a powerful catalyst for convergence The wireless industry should look during for more developments along the lines of these recent announcements Putting aside their intense rivalry Motorola granted L M Ericsson AB a license to use Flex Motorola s high speed paging protocol in the Swedish company s pagers and infrastructure equipment IBM Corp Nokia and the PCS subsidiary of Pacific Telesis Group will work together on making wireless data services accessible to subscribers via IBM ThinkPad laptop computers The ability to send and receive e mail and facsimile messages and to gain access to the Internet will be a key selling point for Pacific Bell Mobile Services in marketing PCS in its service area of California and Nevada the companies said But in the dynamic field of wireless technology the CDMA air interface and its promise of offering times the capacity of analog cel lular no doubt will command the limelight right through The first CDMA system to achieve commercial status was Hutchison Telecom s cellular service in Hong Kong last fall Next up will be a long awaited cellular network built out in Los Angeles by AirTouch Com munications which has spent much time fine tuning it followed by the mid launch of Shinsegi Tele

Cellular operators that employ global system for mobile communications GSM technology in their networks should think long and hard about pairing their services with GSM s higher frequency counterparts DCS and PCS So says Toni Stadelmann deputy managing director of mobile services for Swiss Telecom which has deployed a DCS personal communi cations network PCN in Geneva to go with its nationwide GSM cellular network While its experience with PCN has been limited the Geneva system was rolled out to coincide with the Telecom trade show and conference last October the PTT plans to introduce DCS service in Zurich and Basel next fall as a capacity enhancing supplement to MHz cel lular in these high traffic markets Stadelmann told the PCS in North America conference in Washington last month In the long run he said the company hopes to reach roaming agreements that would tie its PCN service together with Europe s GSM cellular operators and countries that either have PCN already the United Kingdom Germany and France or are contemplating PCN rollouts including Sweden and Italy But there is one sizable problem Wireless equipment manufacturers need to speed up efforts to bring dual band mobile phones to market The subject of GSM DCS handsets also came up during another recent meeting in Washington I don t know of any vendor today committed to developing these handsets Malcolm Cowan general manager of the Richardson Texas based PCS business unit of Northern Telecom Ltd told the PCS Strategies conference If recent contract announcements are any indication however Finland s Nokia Corp may be the first to take the plunge The company has signed a two year contract with Telia Mobitel the biggest GSM cellular network in Sweden for the delivery of base station subsystems that can be used either for a stand alone DCS network or a seamless dual band service The base stations are designed to bolster capacity in areas with heavy calling traffic as well as to improve indoor coverage Savings on Fixed and Operating Costs More Flexibility in Setting Rates Nokia s other recent GSM DCS infrastructure deals were with NordicTel Holdings of Sweden and Sonofon of Denmark It also was the vendor for Swiss Telecom s DCS system For Swiss Telecom scheduled to face competition in PCN beginning in when spectrum set aside for private operators will be opened up pairing GSM and DCS will afford cost advantages in the areas of infrastructure its trans mission network and customer service and billing Stadelmann said According to an analysis in which the PTT assigned different weightings to these cost areas potential savings of percent can be had percent on both transmission network and billing customer service expenses and another percent on infrastructure costs Moreover in limiting its PCN coverage to urban areas Stadelmann said that Swiss Telecom has found that it can devise a rate structure that offers greater appeal to the more price conscious segment of the wire less voice market By setting rates close to those of the wireline network Swiss Telecom hopes to induce customers to switch over to PCN from the fixed network for the mobility it affords But that of course first would require a more robust roaming capability All Stadelmann could do last month was ask rhetorically What are the manufacturers doing He would like to see action sooner rather than later Swiss Telecom Tel Back to Headline List Copyright WIRELESS BUSINESS FINANCE via NewsNet January GLENAYRE NEXUS TEAM UP TO SUPPORT SPREAD SPECTRUM TECHNOLOGY Glenayre Technologies Inc is

hailed the prospect of simultaneous spectrum auctions as a tremendous accomplishment And with good reason While the specialized mobile radio SMR auction that began a month ago generally has moved along at a more sedate pace the C block auction of bandwidth for broadband personal communications services PCS kicked off with a bang on Dec Net high bids for the C block licenses exceeded billion by the end of the fourth round One hopeful Puerto Rico based PCS L P offered an astronomical million in net high bids for basic trading area BTA licenses in the first round skewing the bidding But the hectic activity put to rest at least some doubts about whether the long delayed C block auction would measure up to last year s PCS auction of major trading area licenses Meanwhile SMR operators praised FCC plans to auction wide area licenses for MHz in contiguous blocks of and channels in the MHz band Also two notices of proposed rulemaking NPRMs will allot still more spectrum for use in wireless applications if adopted as final rules by the FCC One would open the GHz band for point to point microwave operations BTA licenses would be auctioned off possibly as soon as a year from now with credits and installment plans accorded to small businesses that wish to bid A provision would permit the processing of pending license applications in the GHz band The other NPRM would give hospitals access to vacant television channels in the very and ultra high frequency bands doubling in many regions the number of frequencies available for remote patient monitoring Higher power levels also would be allowed for medical telemetry devices FCC Tel Back to Headline List
