Reading Area Water Authority Reading Area Water Authority Filter Plant Renovations Pumping Station Upgrades Main Menu Entech Engineering Inc was contracted by the City of Reading to undertake a million renovation of the city s antiquated water system A total of separate projects was completed Major elements of the renovation project include th Ward Tank Replacement Entech provided all engineering design and construction monitoring for this million finished water storage tank The new million gallon tank was constructed adjacent to the Authority s old era riveted steel lead painted storage tank which was dismantled as part of the project Entech conducted a detailed evaluation of steel vs concrete tank type using a life cycle cost analysis which took into account first costs and ongoing future maintenance expenditures Plans and specifications were then prepared for construction of a ft diameter ft high post tensioned concrete tank Also included in the project was the addition of an altitude valve associated by pass piping isolation valves and instrumentation all contained in an underground vault Filter Plant Renovations Provided mechanical civil structural electrical and architectural engineering design and construction inspection services for over million worth of construction projects at the Maiden Creek Filter Plant Projects included concrete and structural repairs for the coagulation channels settling basins and raw water conduits replacement of existing substation and distribution system electrical system upgrades to the entire building including indoor and outdoor lighting chlorine injection modifications and aqua ammonia feed system and bulk storage new carbon feed system replacement of dehumidification equipment boiler burner replacement new filter and backwash control system including motorized valves and electronic filter controls new traveling water screen and bulkhead replacement replacement of sand filter media new fiberglass reinforced sluice gates hydroelectric unit design and start up testing Chlorine Ammonia Building Modifications Prepared plans and specifications for the installation of a multi one ton cylinder chlorine system complete with two new scales one ton cylinders per scale an evaporator for implementation of liquid and or gas chlorination a gallon aqua ammonia tank and two new metering pumps Building renovations were designed to correct the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection s code violations pertaining to the separation of feed storage and adequate ventilation with chlorine sensors for personnel safety Bulk Lime Silo System Provided layout design plans and specifications for the installation of a ton hydrated lime silo system slurry pumps trenching piping foundation and controls Clearwater Basin Repairs Provided mechanical civil and structural engineering design and construction inspection services for over million worth of construction repair projects at the MG underground clearwater basins Projects included partial floor slab removal and replacement construction joint repairs and protection involving the installation of a flexible Hypalon liner system installation of two emergency back up discharge pipe lines and associated valving and coordination of lime sludge removal and drying operations Also conducted complete structural analyses of column supports ceiling arches and foundations and evaluated flow rates capacity chlorine contact time and water quality Distribution System Upgrades Entech developed plans and specifications for a multitude of improvements upgrades to the city s mile distribution system Entech designed and inspected over LF of water main ranging in size from to The distribution system upgrades include the elimination of dead ends via looping replacing existing deteriorated and undersized mains with new larger diameter pipe fire hydrant replacements main line distribution valve replacements and sizes etc In addition Entech worked extensively with PADOT Conrail and the Pennsylvania DEP to ensure proper permitting and safety of installation Examples of other distribution system projects include transferring of services from low pressure to intermediate pressure new pressure reducing valves aerial and underground stream crossings cathodic protection and the development of an operational pipe flow model of the entire distribution system Total construction costs for the distribution system upgrades are in excess of million Maiden Creek Pumping Station Upgrades Upgrade of the pumping station included structural and roof repairs replacement of underground fuel tanks new HP diesel engine and speed reducer for a MGD emergency pump new pump discharge valves operators pump surge anticipator relief system new vacuum system electrical system upgrades including new switchgear lighting and emergency power system electrification of an existing crane and new automated pump controls including a SCADA control system Entech also provide structural analysis of crane and building supports evaluation of electrical heating and pump control systems pump flow tests and flow metering calibration and an energy study to reduce electrical consumption during peak hours Hydraulic Flow Model Entech developed a hydraulic model to simulate pipe network flow analysis of the city s MGD system consisting of miles of to water mains four pressure zones three pumping stations each with two to five pumps four pressure sustaining valves and eleven water tanks reservoirs ranging in size from to gallons SCADA Reading had a very old unreliable centralized reservoir monitoring system to track tank water levels This system was replaced with a state of the art Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition SCADA system which allows the city to accurately track and record not only tank levels but also filter plant performance filter status flows turbidities etc Transmission distribution system pressures residual chlorine and PH levels transmission line flows pump suction and discharge pressures and other data continuously Operational control and status of pumps and storage tank altitude valves is also provided Over points are monitored or controlled by the system GIS A Geographic Information System GIS was developed for the city to quickly access distribution and service information on the computer The system also contains fire hydrant valve and line details in a comprehensive database which is easily accessed over conventional phone lines Work orders and inventory tracking are an integral part of the system
