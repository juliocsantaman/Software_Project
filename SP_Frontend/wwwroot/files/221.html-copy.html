Automotive copied from Technology Access Technology Marketplace Automotive Section October Low Emission Engines from Russia Technology Three different engines using different fuels hydrogen extracted within the engine from methanol using catalysis and the heat of the exhaust the axial engine which automatically changes piston stroke depending on load and comes in gasoline and diesel versions Markets Automotive trucks small vehicles stationary engines aircraft Advantages The developers claim that the hydrogen engine can meet the zero emissions requirement set for California and other states for By generating the hydrogen onboard no new distribution and storage system is needed Alternatively the engine can run on methanol or other fuels directly Carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons are reduced by and NOx by according to the developers The axial engine with its novel arrangement of five or seven cylinders can reduce fuel consumption by engine weight by and emissions by compared to similar horsepower gasoline engines At idle speeds the piston stroke is shortened resulting in fuel economy Status U S patents applied for available for license Estimated cost to develop million in years ACCESS Boris Kisoulenko Chief International Dept Central Automobile and Automotive Engine Scientific Research Institute NAMI ul Avtomotornaya Moscow Russia fax Technology Marketplace Automotive by University R amp D Opportunities Developed by Internet Business Network IBN Return to Recreational Boat Building Industry Home Page
