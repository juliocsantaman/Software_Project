typically held up as an example While it is true that we only absorb about of the calcium from spinach due to its high oxalate content it is incorrect to assume that this automatically applies to all vegetables In fact for low oxalate vegetables such as broccoli turnip kale Brussels sprouts cauliflower and Chinese greens absorption is compared to approximately for cow s milk for tofu for nuts and seeds and for legumes EarthSave News and Views Not only do EarthSave members benefit from knowing that their membership helps to support educational programs but they also benefit from discounts at
