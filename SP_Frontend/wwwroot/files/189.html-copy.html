OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL ROOM U S DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY WASHINGTON D C A OVERVIEW Over the past few years the UAE has developed into a popular base for businessmen tourists and industrialists alike Worldwide the UAE and Dubai in particular is becoming known as an ideal location for trade investment distribution and manufacturing operations as well as a first class holiday destination featuring many of the finest leisure facilities available anywhere in the world The sea faring traditions of the Gulf are well known and even though traditional sailing ships dhows continue to ply their trade across the Arabian Gulf today s vessels are dominated by the power boats and pleasure craft which have become very popular in the UAE Given the coastline attributes of this part of the world it is hardly surprising that watersports should be such a popular past time here A number of U S pleasure craft firms are represented in the UAE such as the Boston Whaler Glastron Bayliner Chapparal and Larson but U S firms can still find capable businessmen interested in generating sales for products new to this market The water jet ski has become very popular in the UAE and is a fast moving product line B MARKET ASSESSMENT The UAE s pleasure craft market is based on the desire of individual nationals expatriates to have their own pleasure craft The sea is accessible within an hour s drive for the majority of the residents of the UAE Local production is of a very high standard and offers quality at a very competitive price Exports of local manufacture are made on a regular basis to all the GCC countries and even to France the Maldive islands and Finland The UAE has a long coastline with no lakes or inland waterways Therefore all pleasure craft are used in the sea and most models purchased are seagoing vessels Traditionally low budget boat owners had to be content with small rowboats which were sometimes fitted with an inboard or outboard engine Today they have the option to purchase inflatable boats or small crafts which are light fast and reliable Lightweight boats are ideal for easy transport However inflatable boats are not very popular here as they are not very good for use on the open sea under rough weather conditions These are mainly used for scuba diving Another factor which works against inflatable boats is price A good quality inflatable boat with accessories could cost almost the same as a small craft manufactured locally Between and annual imports of pleasure crafts to the UAE grew from U S million to U S million an average annual rate of per year The market s growth is expected to continue at an estimated average of over the next years Total UAE imports during were U S million of which million was for yachts and other pleasure vessels and million for commercial vessels U S million of which million was for yachts and other pleasure vessels and million for commercial vessels U S million of which million was for yachts and other pleasure vessels and million for commercial vessels The UAE s total market for pleasure craft in was estimated to be nearly U S million It is estimated that approximately percent of this market demand is met by local production The total market appears to have an annual growth rate of over Locally manufactured boats are popular as they are of a very high quality and available at very competitive prices At present there is a joint venture between a British company and a local company Another Japanese firm Yamaha have just started a joint venture with their local agents building their own boats in Dubai with production starting early September Market sources predict that boat prices will drop in the near future due to the stiff competition of these joint venture operations in the UAE Though boats manufactured locally are of a very high standard the local market in itself is not very big Market sources estimate that approximately of these boats are exported to other Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia Kuwait and Bahrain It speaks volumes when one considers that some Scandinavian countries are buying boats which are manufactured in the UAE as it is comparable to those manufactured in Europe It is cheaper to produce a boat locally than in Europe due to low cost labor The main deterrent to increased export sales to EC countries is high custom duties levied on non EC manufacturers American boats are not price competitive in the UAE any more when you take into consideration high shipping charges American companies will have to seriously consider setting up joint ventures or their own manufacturing plants in the UAE if they want to maintain increase market share The important factors which have a bearing on who succeeds in this market are price service promotion and commitment to the local agent Support and quick response from suppliers are essential to success Boat rental firms have been operating in the UAE for approximately years In popular demand for hire are water jet skis C COMPETITIVE SITUATION In the coming years U S exporters will be well advised not to ignore several new competitors that have appeared on the scene and are working to increase their market share During the period the U S share and its major competitors stood as follows U K ITALY U S PAKISTAN TAIWAN JAPAN Domestic Production The domestic boat industry is medium sized and only directs percent of its output to the local market The other are exported mainly to Saudi Arabia Kuwait Bahrain Oman Qater with a small percentage to France the Maldive islands and Finland There are currently approximately boatbuilders in the entire UAE However the local shipyards are handicapped by the lack of a national motor manufacturer which affects their competitiveness For example of the U S outboard engine motors sold in all were imported U S firms such as Scat Hovercraft Sunfish Laser Inc Wildcat Watercraft Performance Catamarans Inc Boston Whaler Glastron Chapparal have a presence in the UAE market Their major competitors are Kawasaki and Yamaha of Japan Bombardier SeaDoo from Canada Most firms carry a limited volume of stock while some act only as suppliers When local firms act as suppliers they usually place orders with the company only after they receive an order from a customer On an average showrooms in Dubai have on display crafts of local manufacture and different kinds of water jet skis According to industry contacts the advantage that U S firms used to enjoy based on quality reputation and service is fast being eroded as prices which have always been an important factor are no longer competitive Promotion is also important but boat enthusiasts appear quite knowledgeable about the subject from reading reports and tests in foreign boat magazines Local sources say that a boating magazine being prepared in the UAE is in the offing For all cases including pleasure boats and marine engines all distributors agents provide service through their workshop and usually offer a month to a one year guarantee Local manufacturers generally offer a year guarantee for the hull Effective and well organized service is considered to be very important Cost is an important competitive factor particularly in the lower to upper middle price range of the pleasure craft market Price is less of a consideration at the top end of the market where purchasers are less likely to be concerned about discretionary income and expenditures Other key competitive factors in the pleasure craft market are durability safety quality style design speed capacity and accessories It is not easy to sell a used boat in the UAE so the resale value is not a very important factor when buying a new boat though local market sources say that it is not uncommon for a local manufacturer of repute to be approached for boats which have been traded in for newer and faster models D MARKET ACCESS The commercial climate in the UAE is one of free trade and competitiveness There are no impediments to entering the market nor are there any laws regulating the imports of pleasure craft English is the commercial language alongside Arabic but Arabic takes precedence in official documents with Government departments Normal working hours are from or to except Thursday when they close at for all government and public institutions municipal offices banks etc while the private sector resumes for an afternoon session usually from around to Some companies in the private sector have a five day week with the weekends usually being Thursday and Friday or Friday and Saturday All government business must be accomplished during the five morning hours It is not unusual for a civil servant to operate a private business during evening hours No offices open for Friday the day of rest In order to enter the UAE market U S firms must appoint an agent or a distributor Local representation is a legal condition for doing business in the market However care is advised in the selection of an agent In selection of an agent U S suppliers are reminded that the U A E Federal Agency Law No of and its amendments are applicable and should be reviewed carefully prior to appointing a local agent The Agency law favors the local traders and cancellation of agency agreements and contracts are difficult and costly regardless of the severance clauses included Frequent visits and strong agent support by the manufacturer both before and after the sale are the basic ingredients for success The US FCS can assist in identifying reputable representatives Local sources say that the U S market share has been lost partly due to lack of loyalty on the part of American companies to the local agent It is important to bear in mind that agents distributors spend a lot of time and money in promoting a product in this area and when the product gains popularity and an agency agreement has been signed any inquiry received by the U S firm directly from any individual company from the UAE should be routed through the local agent Duty for import of pleasure craft is the usual Pleasure crafts are not presently required to be registered in the UAE Local market sources say that very shortly the UAE Federal Ministry will be enforcing all owners of pleasure crafts in the UAE to have their boats registered They expect this to be put in effect by end this year Distribution and Business Practices Domestic manufacturers sell through distributors and also directly to end users Imported boats are generally retailed by distributors who carry a full spectrum of product lines These importers tend to represent more than one manufacturer frequently three or four specializing in a specific product segment The ability to meet specific client needs for optional equipment timely delivery as well as price are important factors to consider when selling U S pleasure crafts in the UAE No safety standards are set locally but the trend is to go by the standards set by the U S coastguard Approximately marinas are in the UAE which are usually run by the large star hotels or by boat clubs Charges for mooring are high and vary in price from marina to marina The charge is usually based on footage and on average could cost U S per annum for a boat upto feet This charge apart from mooring the boat would usually include maintenance boat washing and sometimes even battery charge Many people who do not want to pay the high costs of berthing their boats at marinas moor them on buoys at sea or keep them on trailers outside their homes Sailing boats can also be kept on beaches Public slipways for launching powerboats are available E TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES There is a wide range of services available for the U S exporter interested in entering the UAE market
