Susanna Lezzi American Consulate Genoa This article consists of pages and contains the following subtopics OVERVIEW STATISTICAL DATA MARKET ASSESSMENT BEST SALES PROSPECTS COMPETITIVE SITUATION MARKET ACCESS TRADE PROMOTION OPPORTUNITIES A OVERVIEW The Italian market for pleasure motorboats including inboard in outboard and pneumatic boats has experienced an exceptional growth during the quinquennium surging two and a half times its sales volume In Italian demand for pleasure motorboats reached the peak of its high development phase This trend was even more accentuated by important laws issued by the Italian Parliament which somewhat alleviated tax burdens for pleasure motorboat owners After this period of astonishing expansion the market has entered a new cycle characterized by stability and even an inflection in its growth rate Nonetheless this has not affected sector imports which in experienced a increase in sales volume current terms and covered approximately of the market demand In particular U S exports to Italy continue to play a preponderant role maintaining an import market share of and actually covering of Italian sector market Notwithstanding the party s over atmosphere prevailing among U S domestic powerboat suppliers and a general slow down currently affecting the European market the stars and stripes production costs about less than the Italian one and thus what is generally viewed as the U S invasion is expected to continue with good sales for small and medium size inboard in outboard and outboard motorboats and especially cabin cruisers and day cruisers B STATISTICAL DATA US MILLIONS PERCENT GAIN Previous Last Current Est Avg Annual Real Year Year Year est Growth Next Years Import Market Local Production est Exports Total Market est

Italian Boating Association U S National Marine Manufacturers Association Italian Naval Register specialized press industry operators C MARKET ASSESSMENT Market Demand In Europe the pleasure boat market has experienced a cyclic growth which reached in the peak of its high development phase This trend was even more accentuated on the Italian market after important laws issued by the Italian Parliament in which contributed to further boost its momentum In brief the inductive type of personal income assessment for Italian resident boat owners became less substantial In addition the value added tax one time doubled for boats over tons was limited to boats over tons approximately meters in length and a new category was created for small boat owners which pay a reduced VAT more consistent with European levels Thus a VAT was applied to small boats under ton and meters and kW a VAT applied to hulls up to tons and a VAT to hulls over tons It is understandable how these laws have positively influenced the growth of the Italian domestic pleasure boat market which chalked up an amazing increase of from to Since year end however the industry has been experiencing a slightly weaker demand for pleasure motorboats Several factors have contributed to this end including the decline in the overall economy with slower growth of personal income and the reluctance of pleasure boat consumers to take on additional debt skyrocketing mooring taxes and lack of an adequate infrastructure to support pleasure boating A pleasure motorboat is by far a discretionary purchase that can be postponed or canceled Thus when the overall economy weakens the demand for pleasure boats also declines The introduction of outrageously expensive and differentiated annual mooring tax rates e g an eight meter motorboat currently costs approximately instead of the previous heavily contributed to dampen consumer purchases Many observers indicate that more affordable marinas and other infrastructures are also badly needed to boost medium term demand Nonetheless U S products strongly desired by Italian dealers and distributors because of their innovations special features and very competitive prices registered a further increase of in sales to Italy Italian demand for U S pleasure motorboats is expected to fare well in the near future although it is not likely to reach the astonishing increases of the recent past End User Profile Thirty years ago there was one boat owner in Italy every five thousand inhabitants currently there is one boat owner every hundred the future could perhaps envision one boat owner every Italy has after all a sea faring tradition coupled with acceptable weather all year round In addition the market should benefit from the fastest growing to and to age groups The latter especially are reaching the maximum wage earning period allowing them to consider such large purchases as a pleasure boat Pleasure motorboats sold in Italy during last official figure available amounted to units for inboard in outboard pleasure boats units for outboard pleasure boats and for pneumatic boats totaling sales for million Close to the same amount is estimated to have been sold in with a increase in the import of the more comfortable medium size inboard in outboard pleasure boats In Italian demand for smaller units slightly decreased with less imports of pneumatic boats and less imports of outboard models notwithstanding the fact that the small motorboat segment is still by far the most popular or rather the more affordable Diesel engines are predominant in the inboard and in outboard configurations This trend generalized all over Europe is even more accentuated in Italy Fuel economy cannot be considered an influencing factor due to low amount of hours per year of navigation for a pleasure boat The dominant criterior is the safety factor for the same reason that the installation of two independent engines has become a standard at sea Gasoline engine powered boats thanks to the increased safety factor of modern designed engines are also increasing their small market share and find favorable application in prestige high performance boats where high speed high power concentration and reduced bulk are taken as major design criteria Outboard engines are of course practically all gasoline fueled D BEST SALES PROSPECTS Since a pleasure motorboat is considered a luxury item anyway it appears that the sale of commodious boats such as medium size cabin cruisers and the more popular small size day cruisers to meters long inboard in outboards is expected to keep up At the same time manufacturers are expected to continue offering smaller units both for logistical and economical factors to appeal to new boating enthusiasts entering the market However there is a weak request at the moment for runabouts Regarding the engines the propeller system seems to be still the most popular and efficient system as long as the propeller is properly designed for the hull and engine characteristics Waterjets are somewhat increasing their penetration both in the small and high power segments While more appropriate for larger and faster boats jet propulsion is well suited to small boats for special applications such as coast guard fire brigades and safe approach of populated beaches where efficiency of the propulsion system is of secondary importance in respect to safety and practical factors E COMPETITIVE SITUATION Domestic Production The Italian market for pleasure motorboats is split almost fifty fifty among foreign and domestic suppliers There are approximately shipyards in Italy all Italian of which about cover of total Italian sales Among these are renowned names such as ABBATE AZIMUT BAGLIETTO RIO and RIVA The remaining are small artisan type enterprises Italian shipyards have an average export share of over of their total billing but in the high prestige segment this share exceeds with some shipyards working exclusively for the export market High technology style according to the world famous Italian design of the hull line and vessel interiors are the main reasons for achieving a high share of this market where price competition becomes a factor of secondary importance The propulsion systems selected by Italian shipyards for powering their pleasure boats appear very international Italian engine manufacturers are present all along the line with diesel and gasoline fueled engines successfully exported all over the world On the other hand Italian shipyards select the engine according to customer and boatbuilder requirements often selecting engines imported from the United States Germany Sweden etc This makes import export figures very high on both sides Italian engines used by Italian shipyards are mainly inboard engines in the lower power bracket both diesel and gasoline to mention just a few IVECO AIFO BPM while in the medium high power bracket the Swedish VOLVO PENTA and the American DETROIT DIESEL and CATERPILLAR have the highest market share The German MAN and MTU are the most popular for engines up to kW and above used on luxury yachts In the Italian market demand increased approximately with domestic production rising from previous year Domestic sales surged chalking up approximately million while exports rose totaling million The slight inflection in the market demand was strongly covered by foreign producers to the detriment of domestic ones whose production dropped an estimated with consequent sales falling both domestically an estimated and abroad Imports In imports of pleasure motorboats totaled million and accounted for of the total market In they reached million covering half of the Italian market While imports rose compared to previous year in they increased which is still obviously remarkable but less than previous year due to the slight inflection in market demand and to the fact that there was perhaps a readjustment by Italian boat dealers who had an excess supply after the large increases of the past In addition to U S suppliers which take the lion s share for imported craft countries which have the strongest presence are U K representing of total imports France with especially strong in the sale of pneumatic boats and Germany Imports are expected to continue to play a key role in the next few years U S Market Position and Share Not only is the U S Italy s principal supplier but Italy is the fourth largest customer in size of destination countries after Canada Japan and Germany In U S imports amounted to approximately million plus compared to previous year representing of total imports and of total market In U S sales in Italy chalked up million plus representing of total imports and accounting for of the Italian market In particular the U S respectively supplied and of imported inboard in outboard pleasure boats and outboard motorboats Well over one hundred U S motorboat manufacturers are present on the Italian market through local importers distributors The latter include CHAMPION RECORD INTERNATIONAL YACHTS MARINA DI VERBELLA MARINE UNION MOTOMAR YACHTING VITALCO and many others Many consider the U S as the leader in the pleasure boating industry Reflecting this trend U S firms are traditionally the most numerous among foreign exhibitors at the renowned annual Genoa International Boat Show Many observers at the show have commented that the stars and stripes production costs about less than the Italian one and some members of UCINA Italian Boating Manufacturers Association are really beginning to fear what is generally looked at as the U S invasion of the market Because U S pleasure boat production enjoys such an excellent receptivity the U S import market share for the next three years is expected to keep up with an estimated annual real growth of about It is unlikely however that it will be able to repeat the amazing performances of the recent past in the short term in view of the general recession currently affecting Italian economy with the consequent drop of consumer expenditures in the more trivial sectors Competitive Factors Competitive prices reputation service and the ability to meet specific client needs for the optional equipment as well as timely delivery are the winning factors for selling U S sector products in Italy A new to market U S supplier should strongly consider participating in the annual Genoa International Boat Show traditionally held around the third week of October It is truly considered one of the best if not the most prestigious boat shows in the world Since the boat show is held in the fall trade participation is very high drawing under a single roof approximately exhibitors of which are foreign participants and visitors and much of the annual business is transacted in Genoa as dealers begin to build stock for the spring sales season F MARKET ACCESS Import Climate In Italy pleasure boats flying the Italian flag with a gross tonnage of more than tons an engine power greater than kW and with unrestricted service must be registered in records which are kept by the port authorities Upon registration the boat is given an identification number and a document which allows it to sail In order to obtain this registration the boat has to comply with strict technical safety requirements which are checked by means of a survey and tests The Italian Naval Register RINA is authorized by the Italian Maritime Administration to carry out the above In order to avoid repeating the same tests on all identical boats the law allows the above tests to be carried out on a prototype upon satisfactory completion of these tests RINA issues an document of approval called Homologation Certificate Regarding the actual procedure the following drawings of the boat are to be sent to RINA Head Office in Genoa for examination and approval structural drawings drawings showing engine installation fuel and bilge systems electric plant and drawings of the rudder and shaft brackets Once the drawings are examined they are returned to the shipyard s agent sometimes with recommendations to be complied with A physical survey is then carried by one of the RINA surveyors in the U S or directly by a surveyor from Italy The surveyor reports his findings to the Head Office in Genoa which if satisfactory issues the Homologation Certificate As previously stated the certificate covers all the mass production of a certain model of pleasure boat Prototypes of boat components which must be homologated include propulsion engines non metallic parts of fuel systems including non metallic tanks fans and blowers for gasoline motor propelled boats and fire extinguishers There is no compulsory requirement for hull materials Once a model has been homologated it is no longer necessary to submit all the others belonging to the same series to the tests already mentioned it is sufficient to provide the Maritime Authority with a copy of the Homologation Certificate on the back of which there must be a written declaration signed no longer by the U S manufacturer but by his Italian agent stating that the product is built in conformity with the prototype A new requirement dated July issued by the Italian Maritime Administration states that foreign shipyards who wish to homologate their prototypes for sale in Italy must have a legal agent resident in Italy This agent must be authorized by the shipyard to carry out the homologation procedure on behalf of the foreign shipyard Moreover this agent will indeed have to sign on behalf of the shipyard the statement of conformity for the mass produced boats For additional specifics U S suppliers should contact RINA see address in Key Contacts list Distribution Business Practices Domestic producers usually sell directly to the end users Imported products are generally retailed by distributors who carry a full spectrum of product lines These importers tend to represent more than one manufacturer frequently three or four each one specialized in a specific product segment There are presently approximately distribution outlets in Italy The more prestigious yachts are sold through brokers As previously stated the Italian government recently announced that only Italian citizens can act as agents for signing off on the homologation standards compliance documents This means that factory personnel of non Italian boat manufacturers imported into Italy cannot sign off on the paperwork Quite often it is the Italian dealers or distributors who signs off and these people are Italian citizens However if the manufacturer terminates the Italian dealer or distributor that party owns the homologation and may charge the manufacturer a royalty for import on behalf of the new dealer or distributor Alternatively the manufacturer can go through the expensive homologation procedure anew The U S National Marine Manufacturers Associatin NMMA has made a ad hoc third party available as the required citizen homologation agent for any NMMA boat builder who can act on behalf of multiple boat companies meeting their requirements of Italian citizenship for the agent but without the downside difficulties of terminating a dealer or distributor who acts as homologation agent For further information U S suppliers should contact NMMA see address in Key Contacts list List of Italian distributors and agents can be obtained through the U S Department of Commerce District Offices from our Commercial Information Management Systems database CIMS and the National Trade Data Bank NTDB Intersted companies may also request through the same channels and Agent Distribution Service ADS or a Comparison Shopping Service CSS Both offer excellent value for money contacts and market information Financing Payments by importers are usually in cash or in maximum days with a letter of credit It is very difficult to establish the mark up imposed by local distributors importers as it greatly varies depending on the type of product Since U S products are in great demand because of their competitive consumer prices it is deemed that the average mark up is not very high and that dealers prefer to rely on selling large quantities Key Contacts TRADE ASSOCIATIONS CONSORNAUTICA Italian Boating
