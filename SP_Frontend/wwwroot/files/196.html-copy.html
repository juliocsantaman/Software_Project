GPS On April a low earth orbiting LEO receiver was successfully launched aboard the Micro Lab satellite This receiver orbiting at an altitude of about km receives radio signals from the constellation of Global Positioning System GPS satellites These radio signals are refracted or bent by the Earth s atmosphere and by measuring the Doppler shifted frequency of the received radio signals these measurements are converted into vertical pressure and temperature profiles of the Earth s atmosphere Early results indicate that accuracies of about to K are being obtained between altitudes of about km to km This new remote sensing technique promises to open up new ways to monitor climate and climate change and also to provide substantially improved initial global data for weather prediction The project is a joint program between the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research UCAR the National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR the Jet Propulsion Laboratory JPL Orbital Sciences Corporation OSC Allan Osborne Associates and The University of Arizona The figure shows a typical GPS MET vertical temperature profile together with nearby high resolution radiosonde soundings CL regular radiosondes RS and interpolated NMC data A For further information please contact Prof Benjamin M Herman
